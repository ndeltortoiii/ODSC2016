# “Open Data for Social Good and Innovation”

## Kirk Borne / Principal Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton
* Abstract: There is open data and then there is opened data. Data scientists are often explicitly invited to explore the latter, though there tends to be much more of the former. The distinctions and benefits of these will be reviewed, with special emphasis on applications of all open data for innovation and for social good through data science.
* Bio: Dr. Kirk Borne is the Principal Data Scientist for NextGen Analytics and Data Science in the Strategic Innovation Group at Booz Allen Hamilton. He previously spent 12 years as Professor of Astrophysics and Computational Science at George Mason University where he taught and advised students in the Data Science program. Before that, he worked 18 years on various NASA contracts, as research scientist and as manager on large data systems.
