# Keynote: Disruptive Data Science  “Coping with the Data Chaos After the Disruption of the Data Analytics over the New BigData Enterprise Platforms”

## Usama Fayyad / Chief Data Officer at Barclays

### Abstract: Unstructured Data and the BigData platforms forces a disruptive change that left most enterprises in a major Data Chaos. The combination of economic drivers in enterprise computing, the need to leverage semi-structured and unstructured Data, and the emergence of the Internet of Things (IOT) is driving a dramatic shift in the Enterprise Data landscape. The advent of Hadoop and the Open Source stack in this space have accelerated the changes to a point of confusion. Today’s business data analyst faces a bewildering environment of technologies and challenges involving semi-structured and unstructured data with access methodologies that have almost no relation to the past. An equal confusion is faced by IT and business users. In the meantime, the ability to drive significant business value from “Data Assets” has never been greater. This talk will cover:
1. Why is BigData different and what is driving the change in storage technology
2. issues and challenges in how to make the benefits of advanced analytics fit within the application environment.
3. The requirement for Real-time data streaming and analysis is stronger than ever.
4. Why Data Science and several related fields become critical to almost all future analytical tasks.
5. How every company is becoming a BigData company, even the smallest of organizations
6. real case studies to demonstrate and discuss the challenges and the great opportunities for BigData and Data Science.

* The right form of question: What will/can you do differently if you have a prediction of [???]
* proper validation framework

* Big dat platform, Customer interatactoin, crm, predictivie analytics, multivariate testings
  1. Being aable to exploit all the data that is available
  2. Proliferating analytics througout the organziation
  3. Drive Business value

* Data Fusion: Can we bring all data together for analysis in CyberSecurity
* Analysis for Cyber Security, Compliance, Fraud, Financial Crime, Marketing, Operations, Pyaments, Settlements, Risk

* Software enineers vs. statisticiancs

* I do not like volume metrics, but they indicate appetite
  * what are enterprises really storing and most expensive
  * A majority of it is unstructured
* 4 vs: Volume, velocity (ETL), Variety (Unstructured)
* 360 view of customer explodes
  * Linkedin, metadata on everything, web searches, social graph on facebook, facebook likes
  
* Value of integration
* Standarizations
* COmprehensiveness
* Data encryption and masaking
* data infrastructure
* data as primary competanence

* Data architecure principles
 1. Dat must be owned 
 2. Data types must have a single definition
   * Data must be traceable back to source **Do this by creating a table with explanations

* Data Lake
  * What happens to this data lake in next weeks? Months? and years?
  * Becomes a toxic lake
    * Who defined the attrib
    * how do vaious pieces of data relate to eahc other
    * how is change in daasources tracked
    * what happens when business entities change

* The data lake according to the waterline
  * we loaded the data now what

* Is this probelm solveable: What does it take to make a data lake sustainable?
  * Is it possible to govern such a thing
    * What is the representation
    * What is the operating model?

* ETL, Metadata Management

* **Driver 1** of hadoop are the cost of storage $20k to $50k down to $1k
  * 451 research has great information on the technology to query the dbs
* **Driver 2** is ETL
  * ETL --> ELT
  * Avoiding the Apps Database Induced Mess
  * Real time data feeds, and batch load data feeds

* Joseph Sirosh The connected cow tracking steps
