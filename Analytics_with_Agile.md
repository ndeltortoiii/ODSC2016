# “Workshop: Big Data Warehouse Case Study with Amazon Redshift and S3″
# “Tutorial: Superpower your Analytics team with Technical Agile – A How To Guide”
## Gil Benghiat / Founder at DataKitchen

* Abstract: Saturday Workshop: The list of failed data warehouse projects is long. Operational projects often leave end-users, data analysts and data scientists frustrated with long lead times for changes and bug fixes. This case study will illustrate how to make changes to the data warehouse and dashboards quickly and with high quality. To start, we first look at a pharmaceutical launch, present the Seven Shocking Steps to Agile Analytics, explain Redshift and other Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies, and show how to implement a Data Lake in AWS. The presenters then examine how to partition the work to teams and walk through examples on how to quickly implement features in the analytic system. Finally, we show how assets migrate between teams and review lessons learned. The speakers are the founders of DataKitchen and have decades of hands on and executive management experience in data, analytics, and software development and are current practitioners of Agile Analytics.
* Friday Tutorial: Are you being forced to choose either fast-and-fragile or slow-and-solid? If so, this workshop can help deliver value quickly and with high quality. First, we will illustrate how to apply agile processes to your department. However, process is not enough. We will also explain the Seven Shocking Steps to create a technical environment to truly enable speed and quality.

* This session will focus on five major topics:
  1. Agile Landscape: a quick tour of what makes Analytics particularly challenging.
  2. Agile Team Process: a review of Agile principles and practices created for software development and how to apply them to Data and Analytics.
  3. Seven Steps: We will outline the seven steps to create a technical environment for agile analytics including how to: add tests, modularize & containerize, do branching & merging, use multiple environments, empower your analyst, use simple storage, and support three workflows.
  4. Measurements: Will will show to how to measure the effectiveness of Agile Analytics through key metrics including sprint burn-down, team velocity, production issues, quality circle, SLA tracking, test inventory, test coverage, and process control charts.
  5. Data Categorization: Learn how to bucket your data into: Analytic Asset, Enterprise Asset, and Non-Essential Asset to gain speed and save work.
