# “Social Media Text and Predictive Analytics”
## Subrata Das / Founder & President at Machine Analytics
### Abstract: The proliferation of social media has led to an explosion of data and opinion, fueling interest in sentiment and social network analyses, especially as individuals, brands and corporations look to manage their reputations and keep up with business intelligence. In order to effectively distill valuable kernels of information from big data and deduce broader conclusions (sentiment), multiple techniques are necessary to employ. You will be taken beyond simple term analysis into the complex world of natural language processing and machine learning for contextual search, document classification, text summarization, topic extraction and information structuring (triples extraction). We will analyze Twitter feeds and Facebook posts, derive sentiment from Amazon and TripAdvisor reviews, and relate market sentiment to stock price movement, using Machine Analytics’ cutting-edge text analytics tool aText and predictive analytics tool iDAS.
